# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

Driver drowsiness detection is a critical application of computer vision and deep learning aimed at enhancing road safety by detecting signs of drowsiness or fatigue in drivers. By monitoring the driver's facial expressions, eye movements, and other physiological cues, such systems can alert the driver or trigger other safety mechanisms to prevent accidents.

In this project, three different deep learning architectures are explored for driver drowsiness detection: InceptionV3, VGG16, and YOLOv3.

InceptionV3: InceptionV3 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is well-known for its performance in image classification tasks. It is characterized by its efficient use of computational resources and its ability to capture intricate patterns in images through its deep architecture.

VGG16: VGG16 is another popular convolutional neural network architecture that is widely used in computer vision tasks. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, consisting of a series of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. While VGG16 may not be as computationally efficient as InceptionV3, it often performs well on a variety of image classification tasks.

YOLOv3: YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time. Unlike traditional object detection approaches that rely on region proposal algorithms, YOLOv3 frames object detection as a single regression problem, making it fast and efficient.
